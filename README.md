# A training pipeline template for benchmark test

The repo is for the benchmark test on the server. It includes a minimal training pipeline under pytorch or tensorflow, some commonly used format for the training data, the scripts to load the data, the profiling metrics, as welll as a large public data set (fastMRI) to do the stress test if needed.

The purpose are:
- be familiar with the main components in the training pipeline
- get suggestions on the data loading process or other process that could speed up the training process and improve the GPU utilization
- test the capability on different platform or hardwares
